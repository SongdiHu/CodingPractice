# Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
#
# Return the running sum of nums.
#
# Constraints:
#
#     1 <= nums.length <= 1000
#     -10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
#
# The problem can be solved by "accumulate()" in one line.
# However, it seems that the approach down below runs faster.
