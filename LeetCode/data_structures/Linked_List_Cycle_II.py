# Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
#
# There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously
# following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is
# connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
#
# Do not modify the linked list.
#
# Constraints:
#
#     The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
#     -105 <= Node.val <= 105
#     pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
